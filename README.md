## Overview

**epidsampler** is a package to simulate an epidemic map with mobility
and social interaction between individuals. Useful for testing sampling
methods.

This package was used to perform the simulations in Alleva, Giorgio, et
al. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06068">“A sample approach to the
estimation of the critical parameters of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics: an
operational design”</a> arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.06068 (2020) and
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06068">“Spatial sampling design to
improve the efficiency of the estimation of the critical parameters of
the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic”</a> (2021) arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.01254.

This package is in the very early stage of development. It is
distributed so users can start to use it and report feedback, but its
interface and/or behaviour is likely to change in the future. It is
generally best to avoid depending on experimental features.

## Installation

The package is work in progress and it is not available yet in the CRAN.
However you can install it directly from the github repo.

``` r
# The easiest way to get epidsampler is to install it from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vincnardelli/epidsampler")
```

## How to use

The simulation is divided in two main function. We generate the map
(regular grid or irregular map) and the individuals using generate().
Then, for each day of the simulation, we simulate the mobility, social
interaction and the evolution of the epidemics with the infection and
evolution of the disease for each individual in the map.

### Map generation

It is possible to generate two different types of maps:

-   regular map or grid

-   irregular map or polygon

``` r
map <- generate(n=25, P=1000, type="grid")
```

<a href="articles/epidsampler.html">Find out more on the parameter of
generate() in the vignette.</a>

### Simulation

``` r
phase1 <- . %>%
  move_uniform(m=0.2, s=3) %>%
  meet(cn=3, cp=4, im=2) %>%
  move_back()

map <- run(map, phase1, days = 21, tE=5, tA=14,
            tI=14, ir=1, cfr=0.15)
```

run() in the vignette.</a>

#### Evolution of the epidemics

First of all, in order to simulate an artificial population describing
the time evolution of an epidemics, we considered a popular model
constituted by a system of six differential equations which, in each
moment of time, describe six categories of individuals, namely: the
susceptibles (S), those exposed to the virus (E), the infected with
symptoms (I), those without symptoms (A) and those that are removed from
population either because healed (R) or dead (D). The figure below
describes diagrammatically the transition between the 6 categories.
